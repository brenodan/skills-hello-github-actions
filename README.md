**Seeing your _action_ in action**: The status of each workflow run that's triggered is shown in the pull request before it's merged: look for **All checks have passed** when you try out the steps below. You can also see a list of all the workflows that are running or have finished running, in your repository's **Actions** tab. You can click on each workflow run to view more details and access log files from there.

- You've created your first GitHub Actions workflow file.
- You learned where to make your workflow file.
- You defined an event trigger, a job, and a step for your workflow.
- You're ready to automate anything you can dream of.

### What's next?

- Make a new branch named `test-workflow`.
- Make a change, such as adding an emoji to your README.md file, and commit the change directly to your new branch.
- In the **Pull requests** tab, create a pull request to merge `test-workflow` into `main`.
- Watch the workflow running in the checks section of the pull request.
- Notice the comment that the workflow adds to the pull request.
- Wait about 20 seconds, then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). Another workflow will run and will replace the contents of this README file with instructions for the next step.
